    <p>
      Simply. Choose a car. We will arrange a detailed inspection. Based on that you can decide whether you want the car. We then buy it, arrange an extended warranty, register it and deliver it to you.

   We process over 7 million ads every day, but we recommend only 10% of them for purchase. With the remaining cars, something often "doesn't fit" us.

    For even greater peace of mind, aside from the warranty for hidden defects, you also have from us an extended 7 -month warranty on the essentials - the engine, gearbox and differential. With, of course, zero involvement and even for an unlimited amount of defects.

        Why do you not show cars for all the dealers?
      </h4>
    
  </div>


  <div class="content3">
  <p>
    We only work with tried and tested dealers and only select cars which meet strict criteria. From 7 million adverts, we only recommend 750,000 cars for purchase, which is however still 10x more than the number of cars on offer in the Lagos. In addition to that, each vehicle must pass a thorough technical inspection consisting of more than 270 parameters before it can be sold. You will receive the result of the entire inspection and photo documentation together with our recommendation in advance.
  </p>

   <div class="top-section" id="top-section1">
      <h4>
       Where do the cars in your offer come from?
      </h4>
    
  </div>


  <div class="content3">
  <p>
    The size of the offer often determines whether or not you find the car you are looking for. So far, customers in the Nigeria have been able to choose from 70,000 cars. However, MARSHALL offers more than 750,000. And each car is just as close as the next - one click away. And since you are buying the car from us, communication is always only in Nigeria, regardless where the car is located. We will take care of any language and legal issues.
If you're looking for a 2017 Volkswagen Golf with a diesel engine and a mileage of at most 50,000 kilometers, you will find about 10 of them for sale in Lagos. You will find at least 153 cars with these parameters at  MARSHALL. And a lot of them at a better price, with better equipment or better looking.

 <h2>
   We arrange a vehicle inspection
 </h2>
 <p>
   We do not own cars in our offer, so we must first thoroughly check them. We know specific models and motorizations perfectly and we know what to focus on for each of them.
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 
 <div id="accordion">
   
   <div class="top-section" id="top-section1">
      <h4>
        Which things do we check?
      </h4>
    
  </div>


  <div class="content3">
  <p>
First of all, we physically inspect each car using the CarAudit service which includes 270 inspection points, VIN verification and detailed photos of any damage. Where possible, we request complete service documentation which we compare with the physical condition of the car and the records from the authorised dealers. We also compare the car with other cars on the market of a similar age and with a similar mileage. We only recommend cars in excellent technical condition.
  </p>
  </div>
  
  
     
   <div class="top-section" id="top-section1">
      <h4>
        Who inspects the car?
      </h4>
    
  </div>


  <div class="content3">
  <p>
    Depending on the car’s country of origin, we either use our network of authorised technicians to perform a thorough inspection, or work with local authorised centres. Everything is performed in line with a standardised process and the result is compared with similar cars on the market. We only recommend cars in excellent technical condition.
  </p>
  </div>

   
   <div class="top-section" id="top-section1">
      <h4>
        What if the car fails the inspection?
      </h4>
    
  </div>


  <div class="content3">
  <p>
Despite the fact that we analyse more than 7 million adverts every day and only pass 10% of them for inclusion in our offer, the result of the vehicle inspection need not necessarily be satisfactory. We will tell you quite transparently why the car didn’t pass and why we are not recommending that you purchase it.
If we find the car to be unsuitable, you will not lose any money and we will refund the inspection fee. You also have the option of choosing another car.
  </p>
  </div>

   <div class="top-section" id="top-section1">
      <h4>
        How much does a CarAudit cost?
      </h4>
    
  </div>


  <div class="content3">
  <p>
    The actual inspection of the car will cost you #80,000 and we are usually able to arrange this within 2 working days. You will receive a detailed report from the inspection together with our recommendation and you can then decide for yourself whether you want to buy the car. The vehicle inspection fee is a one-off fee and covers our costs for the call out of the technician, physical inspection, test drive, verification of the vehicle’s origin and condition, and the recommendation to purchase. If we find the car to be unsuitable, you will not lose any money and we will refund the CarAudit™ payment. You also have the option of choosing another car.
